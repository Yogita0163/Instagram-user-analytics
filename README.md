# 📊 Instagram User Analytics – SQL Project

This is a live project completed during my **Trainity Data Analytics Internship**, focused on analyzing Instagram user behavior using SQL and Excel.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To analyze user engagement on an Instagram-like platform and answer real business questions using structured SQL queries. The goal was to support marketing and investor decision-making with data-driven insights.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (MySQL Workbench 8.0.39.0)
- Data source: Simulated Instagram database (posts, users, hashtags)

---

## 🔍 Business Questions Solved
- Who are the most loyal users?
- Which users are inactive and need re-engagement?
- Who won the photo contest (most likes)?
- What are the top 5 most used hashtags?
- Which day of the week is best for ad campaigns?
- Are users still posting actively?
- Are there fake/bot-like users?

---

## 🧩 Project Approach
- Used SQL queries with `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, `LIMIT`, and filtering logic
- Identified behavioral patterns and trends from platform usage
- Exported key outputs to Excel for clean visual formatting

---

## 💡 Insights & Recommendations
- Loyal users should be rewarded to retain high engagement
- Re-engagement emails should be sent to dormant users
- Ads perform best on Mondays (based on user sign-ups)
- Trendy hashtags like `#love` and `#instagood` drive more visibility
- Bot-like users can be flagged for review due to abnormal behavior patterns
